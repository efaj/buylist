# Buylist

## Usage
Suppose you are going out to buy groceries, but you also have to buy some stuff for your friend Amanda, which you want to keep track separately, but you need to still budget it accordingly to know how much you'll spend. Also, since you are going out, your family asked you to pick up some fast food for them. 

You could plan your buylist with this program by typing the following in it's left pane:

```
* My Shopping List
** Groceries (Must buy)
$1 x10 Tomatoes
$10 x1 Corn Flakes
$2.53 x1 Milk

** Amanda's Errand
$24.99 Diapers

* Fast food
$5 x1 Combo #1 Mike's
$11.98 x2 Combo #2 twins'
```

Next, press "Recalculate Costs".


You can nest as many categories as you want. You'll be able to view each category's price in the right pane.

## Motivation
This software was done because I needed to keep my data stored in clear text, but, at the same time, visualize the total cost and the cost of categories.

We used this format to make our Trading Card orders (Each of us would send one of our friends a file like this, and he would then make the order for all to save on shipping). With this program, I am able to set a category for wishlist, or for different TCGs, to better plan out my final order. 

And the program is general enough that it's useful in even more situations
